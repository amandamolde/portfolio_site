                <h3>The Project</h3>
                <p>Brew Review was my capstone for General Assembly. We were tasked with designing a product that we wanted to build and choosing appropriate technologies to build it. I like to visit breweries, but sometimes I don't know which brewery to go to, so I decided to make a brewery review website.</p>
                <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>I tackled this project individually.</p>
                <h3>Technical Components</h3>
                <p>React | Django | PostgreSQL | Bootstrap</p>
                <p>My focus on this project was to show my abilities in React, so I used Django to get the back-end up and running quickly.</p>
                <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
                <p>The ability for users to upload their own photos to a review.</p>
