                    <p>After getting my feet wet in JavaScript and jQuery, I decided to test my knowledge by building a functioning game. I wanted to spend my time coding rather than thinking of game rules, so I decided to clone an existing game. I chose the game Farkle because it is fun to play and has some complex scoring logic that I wanted to work through.</p>
                    <p>I used JavaScript to calculate many of my functions, and then used jQuery to manipulate how those items displayed on the page. My approach was to work down my user story list in order and to also think of the order in which game play would proceed in real life. I had a physical copy of Farkle at my desk to help me out!</p>
                    <p>Future product features include functionality for hot dice, high-stakes, and a minimum score to get on the score board.</p>
