                    <h3>The Project</h3>
                    <p>PastTents was my first full-stack application.</p>
                    <h3>My Role</h3>
                    <p>PastTents was created with help from Cameron Binion, collectively we are known as team CamAnda! I completed the Models, Views, and Controllers for both the Campsites and the Reviews.</p>
                    <h3>Technical Components</h3>
                    <p>Express | Node.js | MongoDB | Bootstrap</p>
                    <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
                    <p>The ability for a user to upload photos with their review. We used a document-oriented database (MongoDB) because it was the only database we knew at the creation of this project. Going forward, I would use a relational database due to the relationships between campsites and their associated reviews. We could also then tie a created review to a user.</p>
